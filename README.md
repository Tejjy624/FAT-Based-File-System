# FAT-Based-File-System

The objectives of this programming project are:

Implementing an entire FAT-based filesystem software stack: from mounting and unmounting a formatted partition, to reading and writing files, and including creating and removing files.
Understanding how a formatted partition can be emulated in software and using a simple binary file, without low-level access to an actual storage device.
Learning how to test your code, by writing your own testers and maximizing the test coverage.
Writing high-quality C code by following established industry standards.
